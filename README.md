# Facial Emotion Recognition 
A TensorFlow project done in Google Colab and Kaggle to classify images of facial emotions. Implemented techniques such as data preprocessing, building and training deep learning models, validating models and plotting performance. The model uses a multi-layer 2D convoluted neural network with batch normalization and max pooling, and uses softmax activation for categorical classification. Performance enhancements are also included, such as reducing learning rate when a plateau in validation loss is detected. The model achieved an accuracy of 62.85%, whereas the highest accuracy published is 76.82%.
